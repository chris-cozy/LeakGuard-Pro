The first program, leakcount.c, is a detector for memory leaks in another program, which is taken in as an argument.
//KNOWN PROBLEMS
The total leak count and byte amount is implemented, but each individual leak is not recorded.
//DESIGN
Fork + execvp

The second program, sctracer, is a detector for system calls from another program, which it records the statistics for and outputs
//KNOWN PROBLEMS
The text file currently does not correctly create
When using arguments with the program being run by execvp, the output is strange, as if the program didn't run, but when the arguments are removed it runs closer to what's intended.
The count for each specific System call type is not implemented, instead the total sys calls are recorded
//DESIGN
Fork + execvp
